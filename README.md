# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Task

## What I Did
- Created a app (`app.py`)
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app
- Wrote a `Jenkinsfile` to automate build, test, and deploy
- Connected it with Jenkins for CI/CD

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open Jenkins
3. Create a Pipeline job and link it to this repo
